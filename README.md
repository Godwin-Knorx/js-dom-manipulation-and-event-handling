## Introduction

DOM manipulation refers to the process of programmatically changing the structure, style, or content of a webpage using JavaScript. Event handling allows developers to respond to user actions such as clicks, key presses, or form submissions. Together, these concepts enable you to create interactive, dynamic web pages.

This repository aims to provide examples and explanations of how to manipulate the DOM and handle events in an efficient and structured way.

## Getting Started

To begin, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Godwin-Knorx/js-dom-manipulation-and-event-handling.git
```

### Prerequisites

-**Basic Knowledge**
-understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
-**Tools**
-A text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text)
-A modern web browser for testing (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
-**Optional**
-Node.js and npm, if you plan to manage dependencies or use development tools

## Features

-DOM Selection (using `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and more)
-Dynamic content manipulation (adding, updating, and deleting elements)
-Event handling (click, mouseover, form events, keyboard events)
-Practical examples of creating interactive web elements
-Clean, reusable JavaScript functions for manipulating the DOM

## Installation

No external dependencies are required for these examples. However, if you'd like to use npm to manage the project:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Download and install from [here] (https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Initialize npm** (if not already initialized):

```bash
npm init -y
```

3. **Install Dependencies** (if any):

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Open any of the example HTML files in your browser to see the DOM manipulation in action. You can also modify the JavaScript files to test your own Dom manipulation techniques and event  handling methods.

## Running the Project locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Godwin-Knorx/js-dom-manipulation-and-event-handling.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```bash
cd js-dom-manipulation-and-event-handling
```

3. **Open HTML files**:

-**OPtion 1**: Double-click any of the `.html` files to open them in your default web browser.

-**Option 2**: Use a local development server for a better development experience. You can use `live-server` for this purpose.
  **Install live-server** (if not already installed):

  ```bash
  npm install -g live-server
  ```

  **Run live-server**:

  ```bash
  live-server
  ```

This will automatically open the project in your default browser and refresh it whenever you make changes.

4. **Modify and test**:

-Edit the JavaScript or HTML files using your text editor.
-Save the changes and see them reflected in the browser.
